ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Program:
This program reads user data (name, amount, and currency) from a file called coins.txt, processes it, and allows the user to:

View user information

Save the user data into a CSV file

Exit the program

ðŸ“‚ Input:
A file named coins.txt that contains:

Name

Amount

Currency (US$, AU$, or Euro)

ðŸ§  How it Works:

1. Load Data
   Open the file coins.txt

Read the total number of user records

For each line, extract:

Name

Amount (must be between 1 and 95)

Currency (must be US$, AU$, or Euro)

2. Store Data
   If the user already exists, update their currency amount

If it's a new user, add them to the users array

3. Menu
   Show a menu with 3 choices:

View user info

Save data to CSV

Exit

4. View User Info
   Ask for the user's name

If found, display all amounts for each currency

5. Save to CSV
   Save each user's name and amounts in US$, AU$, and Euro to a file called user_data.csv

6. (Optional) Change Calculation
   Although it's declared, you also have some logic ready to calculate and display change in denominations like 50, 20, 10, etc.
